        how to compare two object data and values not its refrence ??<br>

        we can do this by using json (java script object notation )
        json basically are of two 
        one is js object 
        and another one is connecting with server and we do API calling with the help of json 

        but in js json is a builtin object of javascript 
        and it has a very special method <b>Stringify()</b><br>
         it takes anything and converts into a string<br>
        which can converts the object data into string format and
        when we compare two object data then its compare the data and value 
        not its address so we get the accurate result 

        <hr>
        <hr>

        so how we compare objects in js ??<br>
        <b>we first covert them into string using the method 
        stringify() which belongs to an object called JSON </b>
        <br>
        <i>it is a case sensitive</i>
