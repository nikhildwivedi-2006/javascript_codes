    <p>
        callback function is those function in which we can pass the one function as an argument to another function <br>
        a function passed as an arguments to another function is called callback function 

        <br> <br> <br>

        so basically in the above code "show" is a <b>callback </b><br>
        and multiply is a <b>HOF stands for high order function</b>
